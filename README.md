"How might we use technology to build cleaner, greener communities through sustainable innovations?"

**Project Overview:**  

LeafLog  is a light-themed, visually soothing web app that helps individuals build sustainable habits through daily eco-friendly missions and personal action journaling. Designed with a soft green palette and a calm, nature-inspired aesthetic, LeafLog turns environmental responsibility into a rewarding daily ritual.
